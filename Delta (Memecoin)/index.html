      <h1>Protocol Delta Code Green 🟢</h1>
      <div><i>Memecoin with livestreaming of the everyday life of a Ukrainian soldier.</i></div>
      <div class="pending">Status: <b>pending</b></div>

      <h2>About Project</h2>
      <p>Protocol Delta Code Green 🟢 is about launching the RRM memecoin to create a powerful and impactful charitable token and build an ultra-friendly, strong community. A community that will influence the course of wartime behavior.</p>
      <p>As developers, we are not focused on earning money from donation fees. All fees will be spent on equipment, defense infrastructure, and helping people affected by the war. With your support, we will work to obtain legal permission for the official launch of Protocol Delta Code Green 🟢.</p>
      
      <h2>Approximate Roadmap:</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixing all legal “0-day” issues.</li>
          <li>Bringing all dev teammates back on track.</li>
          <li>Creating a safe infrastructure for livestreams.</li>
          <li>Working on collaborations with the government.</li>
          <li>Motivating the community to help us build the project.</li>
          <li>Launching marketing campaigns with partners (influencers).</li>
          <li>Creating more utility around the project so more people can join.</li>
          <li>Doing our best to not let this bubble gum blow up for at least the next decade.</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>

      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>
      <h2>Probably you will ask:</h2>
      
      <h3>When will you launch Protocol Delta Code Green 🟢 ?</h3>
      <p>As soon as we me and you will:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a 100% pure and legal base for the project.</li>
        <li>Get support from the government and Ukrainian armed forces.</li>
        <li>Bring in 1–2 or even 3 top-tier influencers (like WhiteBIT, for example).</li>
        <li>Polish infrastructure to make livestreams safe.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>
      
      <h3>What will RRM Coin holders get?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Free RRM NFTs when the <a href="../Alpha (NFTs)/" target="_blank">Alpha stage</a> is unpaused.</li>
        <li>Priority access to all new features and updates.</li>
        <li>Please go to the question below.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>

      <h3>What approximate utility or new features will you provide?</h3>
      <p>Will answer quickly with hashtags, since I have no time to expand now: #gamification #quests #airdrops #discounts #whitelists #badges #tickets #priority #RWA #DeFiAccess #ambassadors #andMuchMore.</p>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>

      <h3>Will you sell your dev’s coins?</h3>
      <div><i>TODO:(Expand answer, put out of the soul my inner power).</i></div>
      <p>I think no, because there’s no need. They will act more like a gold reserve. Donation fees should be enough. Still considering what strategy will be the best.</p>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>

      <h3>On what will you spend money?</h3>
      <p>
        <i>We will show a public list of needs.</i>
        <br>
        First priority: equipment to defend my military brothers — drones, armor, night vision, medicine, food, etc. When market cap grows and our spin-off donation products will generate more income, we will expand support to civilians. 
      </p>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>

      <h3>How will you get permission from the government?</h3>
      <div><i>Each word can be a miracle and 1 billion worth. Tired... TODO later on.</i></div>
      <p>I hope it’s simple — with your support in building and growing a community around the idea of helping Ukraine and its people. Our armed forces need financial support not only to defend country but for themselves as well. We can handle their wishes without any need to touch our dontation fees or touch us. Your attention is the “numbers of interest” for them and numbers of questions for me.</p>
      <p>The plan is to show them the potential for community growth as well as income streams, by attracting attention from major crypto players (DEXs, CEXs) and other influential figures. They will help us grow quickly and effectively. Money will flow like rivers. The hype around this bubble may make some of you rich, and some not — but it will continually contribute to our main goal.</p>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>

      <h3>If we bring to you billions, how will you behave?</h3>
      <p>Honestly, I almost don’t care about money. Yes, I need them because of enormous debts, but if no one pushes me, I’ll stay calm like a python 🐍. I’m more interested in proving my honor to you by using your support (money, energy) properly, without shady stuff. This project is my, your and our soul. We can sell it, but for sure it won't be good for us in the end of the day.</p>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>

      <h3>What will you do with Alpha RRM NFTs?</h3>
      <p>We will improve smart contracts, maybe change the chain and bridge NFTs, or restart the collection on another marketplace (if we don’t get support from OpenSea, for example). We don’t know the details yet, but one thing is clear: we must continue preparing for launch and try everything that can help.</p>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>

      <h3>“We don’t need your RRM NFTs, they are on Polygon, no hype, how will we earn?”</h3>
      <p>Guys, come on. Together we can move not only NFTs but entire industries. Show your support, help to build a community, invest your free or paid time And we’ll remake, rebuild, or update the old collection and bring it back to life as well as the entire NFT market.</p>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>

      <h3>Why Times New Roman?</h3>
      <p>This typography is a government best practices. Firstly for me it was like a bug, but now I'm okay with it. No more worries :).</p>
      <p>🎖🎖🎖</p>
