      <h1>Protocol Delta Code Green 🟢 Home Page</h1>
      <div class="pending">Status: <b>pending</b> <span>🔺</span></div>

      <h2>About Project</h2>
      <p>Protocol Delta Code Green 🟢 is about launching the RRM memecoin to create a powerful and impactful charitable token and build an ultra-friendly, strong community. A community that will influence the course of wartime behavior. As developers, we are not focused on earning money from donation fees. All fees will be spent on equipment, defense infrastructure, and helping people affected by the war. With your support, we will work to obtain legal permission for the official launch of Protocol Delta Code Green 🟢.</p>
      
      <h2>Aproximate roadmap:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Forcing community to help us building project</li>
        <li>Returning all dev's teammates back on track</li>
        <li>Working on collaboration with goverment</li>
        <li>Trying to fix all legal 0day bugs</li>
        <li>Launching marketing campaigns with partners (influencers)</li>
        <li>Creating more utility around project to let other people join us</li>
        <li>Doing our best to not let this bubble blow in the nearest decade.</li>
      </ul> 
      
      <h2>Probably you will ask:</h2>
      <h3>When you will launch the RRM Coin and Protocol Delta Code 🟢 goverment?</h3>
      <p>Protocol Delta Code Green 🟢 will be initiated as soone as we, now u can try to help with RRMTest memecoin. Maybe to create a community around it and help us to force attention of our leaders.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create 100% pure and legal base for the project.</li>
        <li>Will get support of the goverment and UA military forces.</li>
        <li>Get 1-2 or even 3 top-notch influencers (like Whitebit for e.a).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What will RRM Coin holder get?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Free RRM NFTs when Alpha stage will be unpaused.</li>
        <li>Priority to all project new features and updates.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What approximate utility or new features you will provide?</h3>
      <p>I will answer with hashtags, quickly cause no time to think about it ATM: #gamifications #quests #diferentAirdrops #discounts #whitelists #bages #tickets #priority #rwa #defiAcesses #ambassadors #andMuchMore.</p>
    
      <h3>Will you earn or sell your dev's coins?</h3>
      <p>I think no, cause no need. I think it will be like a gold reserve or something like that. Donation fees probably will be enough. I'm thinking yet to what strategy be the best.</p>
    
      <h3>On what will you spend money?</h3>
      <p>Every time we will show the list of needs. First it's to defend my military brothers. Drones, armors, nightvision, medicines, food, etc. When MC and our spin-off donation product for sale will generate much more income we will spread money on people needs. Ofc if we will get some promises from our goverment and our from our internal armed forces.</p>

      <h3>How will you get permission of the goverment?</h3>
      <p>I hope it's simple with your support via building and growing community in around RRMTest memecoin. We need your support. Your attention are numbers of interest around our armed forces. Cause first: every time we need money to defense our country, second: every time our armed forces need money. So they will be interested for sure. But how we can force them to manage 100% money to charity it's a bit more difficult question. The true answer: we don't know yet, but need to try. So answering the main question: We will show our armed forces leaders community and potential of growth with their assistance. It will atract attention of big crypto players (like DEX and CEX exchangers) as well as regular influencers. They will probably help us to grow. Hype will make some of you rich some of you not, but anyway it will bring result to our main goal.</p>

      <h3>If you will be shoked that our attention and hype around your Memecoin will bring you fantastic income through fees, like billions of dollars, how you will behave? Will you spend money shadley?</h3>
      <p>Personally me almost don't give a fuck money. I'm interested in them I'm really in need about them because of enormous depts, but if nobody will push me or force me I will be calm like a python. I'm more interested to prove you my honor towards you to infest your energy (money) in a proper way without any shady shit. I think in such projects this one in long brings much more.</p>
    
      <h3>What will you do with Alpha RRM NFTs?</h3>
      <p>We will make improvements in smart-contracts, maybe will change chain and bridge NFTs, maybe will restart collection on other giant markeplace (if won't get some support on Opensea for e.a.). We don't know yet. Just one is clear. Need to continue preparing for launch and try everything can asist us.</p>

      <h3>We don't need your RRM NFTs they are on Polygon, No hype around it, ho we will earn?</h3>
      <p>Guys common. Together we can move stars not only NFT industry. Show us your support via building some kind of community and invest your free or paid time in us and we will remake, rebuild or update old collection and bring it to life again as an entire NFT market.</p>
