      <h1>🌍 Real RPG Man — Story and Mission 🌍</h1>
      <h2>💡 Global Vision:</h2>
      <p>Real RPG Man is a community-driven ecosystem created to support Ukraine’s recovery and build a better future. We combine charity, NFTs, and simple gamification to turn creativity and technology into real help for people. Anyone can join, donate, and be part of something meaningful.</p>
      <h2>🧟 From Dev's Mind:</h2>
      <p>The spirit of true warriors created the Real RPG Man's idea, keeps it alive, and pushes us forward to work on it even when we feel almost destroyed. This project will honor the memory of every broken team, every fallen soldier and every ordinary human life — fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters — who lived with dignity but lost their chance to see peace again.</p>
      <!-- <p>Before joining the Ukrainian military forces, I worked so hard on this project with my team, under so much stress, that I suffered something like a mini-stroke. It slowed my thinking, and sometimes I even forget simple things for a few seconds.</p>  -->
      <!-- <p>This shows how much this project means to me. Now, during my service in the Ukrainian army, I unexpectedly found a little space to breathe and reflect on Real RPG Man (much respect to my military leaders who support me in this). Thanks to the new memecoin trend and the power of crypto communities, I see a real chance to bring Real RPG Man back to life.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>The main goal of this test coin is simple: I want to go through the full process of creating and launching a token, from A to Z, and feel how it really works. If by surprise this test coin gets hype (in crypto, crazy things sometimes happen), then the side goal will be to bring back my old team and start building something truly big for users.</p> -->
      <p>We plan to livestream the daily life of a regular soldier in the Ukrainian army — simple things like cleaning weapons, fixing military equipments or helping regular people who got suffered in war to bring their lives back. No blood, no violence. Only real, honest moments that show how we try to keep the sky peaceful for all people.</p>
