🌍 Real RPG Man — Story and Mission 🌍

💡 Global Vision:
Real RPG Man is a community-driven ecosystem created to support Ukraine’s recovery and build a better future. We combine charity, NFTs, and simple gamification to turn creativity and technology into real help for people. Anyone can join, donate, and be part of something meaningful.

🧟 From Dev's Mind:
The spirit of true warriors created the Real RPG Man's idea, keeps it alive, and pushes us forward to work on it even when we feel almost destroyed. This project will honor the memory of every broken team, every fallen soldier and every ordinary human life — fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters — who lived with dignity but lost their chance to see peace again.

We plan to livestream the daily life of a regular soldier in the Ukrainian army — simple things like cleaning weapons, fixing military equipments or helping regular people who got suffered in war to bring their lives back. No blood, no violence. Only real, honest moments that show how we try to keep the sky peaceful for all people.
